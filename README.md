# CS798H-Project-23-24-II

In the final project of Human Computer Interaction (HCI), we were supposed to pick any existing digital product, gather data about it from the users and present fixes for the top 2-5 user interaction problems associated with it. 

## We picked the 'Coursera Mobile Android Application'.

There were three milestones in the project we needed to achieve.

## Milestone 1:
In the first milestone, we formed a diverse team consisting of individuals interested in visual art, data analysis, interpersonal communication, and writing. After that, as a team, we picked the digital product we were going to improve: Coursera Mobile Android App. We then developed a comprehensive data gathering (empathizing) plan, which involved web scraping app review data from the Google Play Store for the last 7 months to ensure that the data was not outdated. Feedback from other teams was taken and based on it, we formed a revised plan with some minor modifications. 

## Milestone 2:
For the second milestone, we implemented our data gathering plan. We employed a qualitative coding method for analysis of the obtained review data. An open coding approach was utilized, inter-rater reliability (IRR) was calculated and a final codebook was created. After ensuring that the final coded data had minimum bias, we plotted a graph of codes vs frequency of codes to identify the most common issues faced by people. In order to create a priority list, we removed any issues that weren't related to user interaction (for ex. loading, syncing, downloading issues, etc.) since they were beyond the scope of our course. Finally, we described the top 5 problems with the app that we intended to fix along with our potential solutions.

## Milestone 3:
Our final milestone consisted of us building prototypes for our proposed solutions. We built low-fidelity prototypes on papers first, and based on these high-fidelity prototypes were built using Procreate and PowerPoint. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our solutions, we used the cognitive walkthrough method. We created a user persona after rigorous research and then answered questions based on her thinking patterns and expectations. We also covered some issues with our current prototypes and suggested solutions that could be implemented in the future, which concluded the third and final milestone of our project.
